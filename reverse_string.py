Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

def reverseString(str):
    str [:] = str[::-1]

input_1 = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
reverseString(input_1)
print(input_1)
